# React 19 useEffect Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue where the cleanup function in a `useEffect` hook might not always be called when a component unmounts in React 19.  This can lead to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

Under certain conditions (often involving complex component trees or concurrent rendering), the cleanup function within `useEffect` might be skipped during unmounting.  This is particularly noticeable when combined with specific state update patterns or transitions.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the console logs. The 'Cleanup!' message may be missing in some cases, indicating that the cleanup function is not being executed.

## Solution

The provided solution includes a revised component addressing the issue and ensuring consistent cleanup.

## Additional Notes

This issue may be linked to specific React 19 behavior or interactions with other libraries. It's important to carefully analyze the component hierarchy and rendering process to isolate the underlying cause.
